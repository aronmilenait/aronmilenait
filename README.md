# About
Software developer working in the field since 2023. Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge of GNU/Linux and studying DevOps practices, while also pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of the People at my own pace.

I have been using GNU/Linux as my only operating system since 2015, which led me to pursue a career in Software Development. Currently, I use the Fedora distribution.
