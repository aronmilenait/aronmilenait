# About
Self-taught software developer working in the field since 2023. Although my experience is mostly focused on front-end development, I also enjoy developing at the back-end. What I like most about my job is providing solutions, solving problems, and making improvements. I also enjoy being in a constant learning process.

I have been using GNU/Linux as my only operating system since 2015, which led me to pursue a career in Software Development. Currently, I use the Fedora distribution.
